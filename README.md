DEV_dsPIC
=========

Author : DIB Guillaume

Beginning date : 05/2013

This project is an Arduino_like project based on dsPIC33F µC.
Boards : 

- Main Board : Programmed by Pickit3, different alimentation possibilities,
  	LEDs for debug and I/O on headers.
  	
- Motor Shield : Double full H bridge based on L6205, Connectors for encodeurs, 
		  possible choice between DC and stepper motors.
		  
- Sensors and Actuator Shield : General connectors for analogique sensors (with voltage division),
		Connectros for Servomotors & AX12, segmented display, breadboard or proto lines.
		
- Remote Shield : Joysticks and pushbutton with a 2.4GHz transmitter to change the µC into a remote.

- Screen Shield : An LCD screen with a dedicated SD card.

I also plan on preparing a simple template and some librairies to simplify the use of the µC.
